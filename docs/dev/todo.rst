A couple of idioms for contributors
-----------------------------------
These are general guidelines for code contributors.

* keep amount of external dependencies low, i.e. if it can be done using the
  standard library, do it using the standard library
* do not prefer specific operating systems, i.e. even if we love Linux, we
  shall not make other suffer from our personal choice
* write unittests
