A couple of idioms for contributors
-----------------------------------
These are general guidelines for code contributors.

* keep amount of external dependencies low, i.e. if it can be done using the
  standard library, do it using the standard library
* do not prefer specific operating systems, i.e. even if we love Linux, we
  shall not make other suffer from our personal choice
* write unittests


Loose wishlist of todos
-----------------------
* linux packages?
* add support for duckdns http://www.duckdns.org
* add support for gnudip http://gnudip2.sourceforge.net/
* add support for linode https://github.com/myano/linode-dyndns
* usability: provide a mechanism to store credentials "safely". For example using
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring. This should be optional (from an API
   point of view), and it should be easy to setup during a first run
   (interactive use).
* technology: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyatomiadns this looks like an RFC2136
  implementation
